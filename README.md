# Videogame Sales Analysis

## Scenario
As a data analyst for Xbox, I was tasked with analyzing the Japanese market to identify strategies to increase their market share in Japan.

## Key Insights
-  <b>Insight 1: </b> Video game sales peaked in 2008 during the 7th game generation (2005â€“2017) and have been declining since, with a brief rise following the launch of the 8th generation.
- <b>Insight 2: </b> The top 5 gaming genres in Japan differ significantly from those globally.
- <b>Insight 3: </b> Xbox focuses on popular genres in other regions, while Nintendo and PlayStation adapt to Japanese preferences.

## Recommendations
- Conduct market research into Japanese gaming culture and tailor your market entry strategy to align with these preferences.
- Investigate the factors contributing to the success of the 7th generation for further insights.

## About This Project
I conducted the analysis using PostgreSQL and Power BI, working with a dataset from Maven containing 64,000 rows. In PostgreSQL, I built a mini-database, cleaned and prepared the data, and performed initial analysis. I then used Power BI to create a trend and performance report focusing on the Japanese market. Below you can read additional explanation to the insights.

- <b>Insight 1</b> is illustrated by the stacked area chart showing total sales over time. The chart highlights the peak during the 7th generation and the subsequent decline, with the impact of different generations clearly visible.
- <b>Insight 2</b>: Is found by the initial analysis in PostgreSQL and visualized using a treemap in Power BI. The treemap compares the top 5 genres sold in Japan to those sold globally, revealing differences in genre popularity.
- <b>Insight 3</b>  Is found by comparing the donut charts. The top chart displays the share of top 5 genres sold in Japan, while the bottom chart shows global sales. The comparison reveals that Xbox maintains a consistent genre focus, with Shooter and Action being prominent. In contrast, Nintendo and PlayStation's donut charts show a greater variation, and more similarity to the genres visualized in the treemap, reflecting their adaptation to Japanese market preferences.
