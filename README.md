About This Project
I conducted the analysis using PostgreSQL and Power BI, working with a dataset from Maven containing 64,000 rows. In PostgreSQL, I built a mini-database, cleaned and prepared the data, and performed initial analysis. I then used Power BI to create a trend and performance report focusing on the Japanese market.

<b>Insight 1<b>: This is illustrated by the stacked area chart showing total sales over time. The chart highlights the peak during the 7th generation and the subsequent decline, with the impact of different generations clearly visible.
Insight 2: Initial analysis in PostgreSQL and visualized using a treemap in Power BI. The treemap compares the top 5 genres sold in Japan to those sold globally, revealing differences in genre popularity.
Insight 3: Found by comparing donut charts. The top chart displays the share of top 5 genres sold in Japan, while the bottom chart shows global sales. The comparison reveals that Xbox maintains a consistent genre focus, with Shooter and Action being prominent. In contrast, Nintendo and PlayStation's charts show a greater variation, reflecting their adaptation to Japanese market preferences.
